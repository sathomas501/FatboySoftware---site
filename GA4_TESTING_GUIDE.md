# GA4 Event Tracking - Testing Guide

Your GA4 setup now includes **automatic debugging** that logs all events to the browser console. Here's how to test and verify everything is working.

## Quick Test (30 seconds)

### Test Locally

1. **Start Jekyll server:**
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

2. **Open your site:**
   - Go to: `http://localhost:4000`

3. **Open Browser Console:**
   - Press `F12` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+J` (Mac)
   - Click the **Console** tab

4. **Check for startup messages:**
   You should see:
   ```
   🔍 Analytics Events: Initializing...
   ✅ Analytics Events: gtag is loaded and ready
   ✅ Download button event listener attached
   🎉 Analytics Events: Setup complete!
   💡 Tip: Type testGA4() in console to send a test event
   ```

5. **Click "Download Free Version" button**
   You should see:
   ```
   📥 Download Event Fired: {
     event: "download_free_version",
     category: "engagement",
     label: "Free Version v3.3",
     url: "https://github.com/..."
   }
   ✅ Event sent to Google Analytics
   ```

---

## Manual Test Event

Type this in the browser console:
```javascript
testGA4()
```

You should see:
```
🧪 Testing GA4...
✅ Test event sent! Check GA4 Realtime > Events
```

Then check **Google Analytics** → **Realtime** → **Events** and you should see `test_event` appear.

---

## Verify in Google Analytics (Production)

### Step 1: Deploy to GitHub Pages

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add GA4 event tracking with debugging"
git push origin main
```

Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild.

### Step 2: Test on Live Site

1. Visit: `https://fatboysoftware.com`
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. You should see the startup messages
4. Click "Download Free Version"
5. Check console for the download event log

### Step 3: Check GA4 Realtime

1. Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
2. Select your property
3. Click **Reports** → **Realtime**
4. You should see:
   - **1 user right now** (you)
   - Under **Event count by Event name**, look for `download_free_version`

### Step 4: Click the Download Button

1. Click "Download Free Version" on your live site
2. Within 5-10 seconds, you should see the event appear in **Realtime > Events**
3. Click on the event name to see details (category, label, etc.)

## Understanding the Console Messages

### ✅ Success Messages

| Message | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `✅ Analytics Events: gtag is loaded and ready` | GA4 tracking code loaded successfully |
| `✅ Download button event listener attached` | Download button is being tracked |
| `📥 Download Event Fired` | User clicked download button |
| `✅ Event sent to Google Analytics` | Event successfully sent to GA4 |

### ⚠️ Warning Messages

| Message | What It Means | Fix |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| `⚠️ Download button (#download-free-version) not found` | You're on a page without the download button | Normal on other pages (only appears on homepage) |

### ❌ Error Messages

| Message | What It Means | Fix |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| `❌ gtag is not defined` | GA4 script didn't load | Check `google_analytics` in `_config.yml` or disable ad blocker |

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: No console messages appear

**Likely causes:**
- Jekyll didn't rebuild the site
- Browser cache is stale
- Wrong page (try homepage)

**Fix:**
```bash
# Stop Jekyll server (Ctrl+C)
# Clear Jekyll cache
bundle exec jekyll clean

# Rebuild and serve
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Hard refresh browser
# Windows/Linux: Ctrl+Shift+R
# Mac: Cmd+Shift+R
```

### Problem: "gtag is not defined"

**Cause:** GA4 tracking script didn't load

**Fix:**
1. Check `_config.yml` has: `google_analytics: G-5RWQHBCC99`
2. Verify `_includes/google-analytics.html` exists
3. Check `_layouts/default.html` includes both:
   - `{% include google-analytics.html %}`
   - `{% include analytics-events.html %}`
4. Disable ad blockers (they block gtag.js)

### Problem: Events in console but not in GA4 Realtime

**Cause:** Events are being sent but GA4 isn't receiving them

**Possible reasons:**
1. **Ad blocker** - blocking the network request to GA4
2. **Wrong Measurement ID** - check `_config.yml`
3. **Delay** - can take 5-30 seconds to appear in Realtime
4. **Privacy mode** - some browsers block analytics by default

**Fix:**
1. Disable ad blockers
2. Try in incognito/private mode
3. Wait up to 60 seconds
4. Check Network tab in DevTools for requests to `google-analytics.com`

### Problem: Download button click doesn't log anything

**Cause:** Event listener not attached

**Fix:**
1. Check console for: `✅ Download button event listener attached`
2. If missing, verify you're on the homepage (`index.md`)
3. Check the download link has `id="download-free-version"`
4. Rebuild Jekyll and hard refresh

## Monitoring in GA4

### View Events (Last 30 minutes)

2. Shows events from past 7/30/90 days
3. Can filter by event name, date range, etc.

### Create Custom Report

3. Add dimension: `Event name`
4. Add metric: `Event count`
5. Filter: `download_free_version`

## Tips

### Console Always Open
When testing locally, keep the browser console open so you can see events fire in real-time.

### Use Incognito Mode
Test in incognito/private browsing to avoid:
- Browser extensions interfering
- Cached versions of your site
- Ad blockers (usually disabled in incognito)

### Clear Jekyll Cache
If changes don't appear:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll clean
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Hard Refresh
Always hard refresh after deploying:
- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+R`
- Mac: `Cmd+Shift+R`

## What's Next?

Once you've confirmed events are working:

1. **Mark events as Conversions in GA4:**
   - Go to **Admin** → **Events**
   - Find `download_free_version` and mark as conversion
   - Find `purchase` and mark as conversion

2. **Set up custom reports** to track:
   - Download conversion rate
   - Purchase conversion rate
   - User journey from homepage → download → purchase

3. **Remove debugging** (optional):
   - Once confirmed working, you can remove `console.log()` statements
   - Or leave them - they're helpful for troubleshooting
