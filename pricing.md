### What if I start with Free and want to upgrade later?

No problem. Your Founding Member price is locked in as long as spots remain.

If you're one of the first 200 users of the Free version and later decide to upgrade, you'll still get the $149 Founding Member price.

After 200 Founding Members, the upgrade price will be higher.

### Is the $149 price really locked in forever?

Yes. You pay $149 once. No subscriptions. No annual fees. No "upgrade to the new version" charges.

You'll get:
- Free updates for major tax law changes
- Free feature updates and improvements
- Free bug fixes and performance improvements
- Lifetime access to the software

### What payment methods do you accept?

We'll accept credit cards, PayPal, and other common payment methods through our payment processor. 

### When does the Founding Member offer end?

When we reach 200 users. Could be weeks, could be months. We're not putting a time limit on it because we'd rather get 200 engaged users than rush to hit an arbitrary deadline.

### What platforms are supported?

- **Windows 10/11** - Fully tested, currently in beta
- **Linux** - Experimental (working, being refined)
- **macOS** - Coming soon


### Do you offer educational or non-profit discounts?

Not yet, but we're open to it. Email us and let's talk.

### Will the Free version always be free?

Yes. The Free version will always be available at no cost with the features listed above. We believe in a genuinely useful free tier, not a crippled trial.

## Not Sure Which Version You Need?

**Start with Free.** Seriously.

The Free version is fully functional retirement planning software. It's not a demo. It's not crippled. It's not a trial.

Most people can do their entire retirement plan with 3 scenarios. If you find yourself wanting more scenarios or advanced features, upgrade to Pro. Your Founding Member pricing is locked in.

**Here's the decision matrix:**

**Stay with Free if:**
- You're planning a straightforward retirement
- 3 scenarios is enough (baseline, optimistic, conservative)
- You don't need advanced Roth conversion optimization
- You're comfortable with basic tax planning tools

**Upgrade to Pro if:**
- You want to model many different strategies
- You're doing sophisticated Roth conversion planning
- You want advanced tax optimization features
- You love data visualization (Sankey diagrams)
- You want to work backwards from specific retirement goals
