## Fatboy Software

**No stock photos of beaches. No grassy fields. Just serious retirement planning software.**

We're building planning tools for people who want to figure out their retirement without hiring a financial advisor or getting sold an annuity.

## Why Fatboy Financial Planner

### Real planning tools, not a glorified calculator
You know those "advisor-level" features other software brags about? We actually built them. This isn't a retirement calculator with delusions of grandeur.

### Free to start. One-time upgrade if you need more.
Start with the free version - it's actually useful, not a bait-and-switch trial. Need advanced features or unlimited scenarios? One-time $XXX upgrade. No subscriptions. No annual "updates" that are just bug fixes with a new price tag.

### "What if I..." actually works here
Want to see what happens if you retire at 62 instead of 65? Convert $50k to Roth? Pay off your mortgage early? **Model what happens when TCJA expires in 2026?** Edit tax parameters yourself - federal and state. Every change flows through to cash flow, taxes, and actual outcomes you can understand.

## How It Works

1. **Tell us where you're at**
   Your age, accounts, debts, spending, and the assumptions you're making (inflation, returns, salary growth, COLA).

2. **Build and compare scenarios**
   Different retirement ages. Roth conversion strategies. Withdrawal orders. Big life events. **Different tax law scenarios.** See what actually happens.

3. **Explore until it clicks**
   Interactive charts and comparison dashboards. Edit tax parameters to model future law changes or state tax scenarios. No babbling brooks or sunset imagery - just data you can actually use to make decisions.

## System Requirements

**Desktop application. Your data stays on your machine. Where it belongs.**

### Supported Platforms
