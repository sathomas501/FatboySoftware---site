**No stock photos of beaches. No grassy fields. Just serious retirement planning software.**

We're building planning tools for people who want to figure out their retirement without hiring a financial advisor or getting sold an annuity.

## Why Fatboy Financial Planner

### Real planning tools, not a glorified calculator
You know those "advisor-level" features other software brags about? We actually built them. This isn't a retirement calculator with delusions of grandeur.

### Free to start. One-time upgrade if you need more.
Start with the free version - it's actually useful, not a bait-and-switch trial. Need advanced features or unlimited scenarios? One-time $TBA Pro version upgrade. No subscriptions. No annual "updates" that are just bug fixes with a new price tag.

### "What if I..." actually works here
Want to see what happens if you retire at 62 instead of 65? Compare a lean, work-longer lifestyle to a "live large" spend-more-now lifestyle. Convert $50k to Roth? Pay off your mortgage early? **Model what happens when TCJA expires in 2026?** Edit tax parameters yourself - federal and state. Every change flows through to cash flow, taxes, and actual outcomes you can understand.

Lifestyle scenario comparisons let you set up different versions of your plan (lean, baseline, live large, semi-retired, etc.) and see the tradeoffs in spending, taxes, and long-term outcomes side by side.

### Find your plan's breaking points (Pro)
Stop guessing about safety margins. **Breakpoint analysis** finds the exact threshold where your plan fails. How low can returns go? How much can you safely spend? Which assumptions actually matter? Interactive stress tests with color-coded risk zones show you exactly where you stand. Sensitivity analysis tells you what to worry about and what to ignore.

**[See how we compare](/comparison)** to the other guys (spoiler: we're cheaper and you actually own it).

## How It Works

1. **Tell us where you're at**
   Your age, accounts, debts, spending, and the assumptions you're making (inflation, returns, salary growth, COLA).

2. **Build and compare scenarios**
   Different retirement ages. Roth conversion strategies. Withdrawal orders. Big life events. Lifestyle-driven scenarios (lean vs baseline vs live large). **Different tax law scenarios.** See what actually happens as you dial your lifestyle up or down and compare it across plans.

3. **Explore until it clicks**
   Interactive charts and comparison dashboards. Edit tax parameters to model future law changes or state tax scenarios. No babbling brooks or sunset imagery - just data you can actually use to make decisions.

## System Requirements

**Desktop application. Your data stays on your machine. Where it belongs. Do you really need to life plan on your phone?**

### Supported Platforms
- **Windows 10/11** - Fully tested, currently in beta
- **Linux** - Experimental (it works, we're just making sure it really works)
- **macOS** - Coming soon

### Minimum Requirements
- **RAM:** 2 GB minimum, 4 GB recommended
- **Disk Space:** 100 MB
- **Display:** 1366x768 minimum (but seriously, get a bigger monitor for this stuff)
- **Internet:** Optional - only for downloading tax data updates

### The Privacy Thing
Everything runs on your computer. No cloud. No "syncing to our servers for your convenience." No data harvesting. Your financial data is yours, not ours.
