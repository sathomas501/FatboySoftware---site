# Fatboy Software

Financial and retirement planning, without the spreadsheets.

We’re building a simple app that helps you understand, plan, and track your path to retirement — without needing to be a financial expert.


## Why FB Retirement Planner

### Advisor-level depth, without the sales pitch
Built for people who are comfortable managing their own portfolios, but want better tools than a basic spreadsheet.

### One time license fee, no management fees, or yearly subscriptions
This is a single time license fee, no percent under management or yearly subscription fees. Your life changes, change your plan - you own it!

### Designed for “I want to see the impact”
Every change—retirement age, spending, conversions, debts—flows through to cash flow, taxes, and long-term outcomes you can actually see.

## How It Works

1. **Enter your current picture**  
   Add your age, accounts, debts, spending, and key assumptions (inflation, returns, salary growth, COLA).

2. **Build and compare plans**  
   Create scenarios: different retirement ages, Roth strategies, withdrawal orders, and big events.

3. **Explore and refine**  
   Use interactive charts and comparison dashboards to see what works best, then tune until you’re comfortable with the trade-offs.
