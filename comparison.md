## Tax Assumptions: Planning Direction vs Tax-Filing Precision

### Our Approach: You Control the Tax Assumptions

Fatboy Financial Planner lets you **edit every tax parameter** - both federal and state. Not just accept whatever we give you. You can customize:

- **Federal tax brackets and rates** (including future law changes)
- **Standard deductions** (by filing status)
- **Social Security taxation thresholds**
- **Capital gains brackets**
- **IRMAA (Medicare surcharge) thresholds**
- **RMD age and factors**
- **State tax rates and brackets**

Want to see what your plan looks like when TCJA expires in 2026? Change the brackets. Want to model a state income tax increase? Edit it. Want to see what happens if Congress changes capital gains rates? You're in control.

### Why This Matters for Planning

**This is planning software, not TurboTax.** We're not trying to file your taxes - we're helping you make smart decisions:

- Should I retire at 62 or wait until 65?
- When should I do Roth conversions?
- What withdrawal order costs me less in taxes?
- How will a $50k income change affect my Medicare premiums?

**For these questions, close enough is good enough.** Whether your effective tax rate is 18.3% or 18.7% doesn't change whether retiring at 62 vs 65 makes sense.

### Subscriptions vs Control: The Real Trade-off

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

| Subscription Services | Fatboy Financial Planner |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Auto-updated tax rates (tied to ongoing payments) | You edit tax parameters yourself - federal and state |
| New rates appear automatically | You decide when and what to update |
| Can't model future tax law changes | Model TCJA expiration, proposed tax changes, state tax scenarios |
| Locked into their assumptions | Full control - edit any tax parameter |
| One tax scenario at a time | Run multiple scenarios with different tax laws |

</div>

### When Do Tax Rates Actually Change?

Less often than subscription services want you to think:
- **COLA adjustments**: Annual inflation bumps to brackets (~3-5%)
- **Major tax law changes**: Every 5-10 years (like TCJA in 2017, expiring 2026)
- **Impact on your decisions**: Usually minimal

### What We'll Do

- **Free updates** for major tax law changes (like when TCJA expires in 2026)
- **Simple self-service updates** for annual COLA adjustments (seriously, 2 minutes)
- **Clear documentation** on updating assumptions from IRS publications
- **Transparent defaults** - we'll tell you what year and source we're using

### The Bottom Line

**Subscription services offer automatic updates. We offer control.**

For retirement planning, being able to model different tax scenarios is more valuable than having auto-updated rates. Want to see your plan under current law vs. post-TCJA? Different state tax scenarios? Proposed tax changes? You can model all of it. And you're not paying annually for updates you control yourself.

**Important:** Fatboy Financial Planner is a planning tool, not a source of tax, legal, or financial advice. Always consult qualified professionals before making major financial decisions.

## Who Is This For?

### This is for you if:
- You'd rather **pay once** than pay every year
- You're comfortable managing your own money
- You want **real planning tools** without paying advisor fees
- You like playing with scenarios to see what happens
- You prefer your financial data on **your computer, not ours**

### Probably not for you if:
- You want automatic account syncing (we're manual/CSV import only)
- You need comprehensive estate planning (that's not us)
- You want financial advice (we're software, not advisors)

## Try It

We think you'll like Fatboy Financial Planner. It'll save you money and give you the tools you actually need.
