## Tax Assumptions: Planning Direction vs Tax-Filing Precision

### Our Approach: Full Control Over Your Assumptions

FB Retirement Planner gives you **complete control** over tax assumptions - brackets, deductions, thresholds, and rates. You can customize all key tax parameters including:

- Federal tax brackets and rates
- Standard deductions (by filing status)
- Social Security taxation thresholds
- Capital gains brackets
- IRMAA (Medicare surcharge) thresholds
- RMD age and factors
- State tax rates

### Why This Matters for Planning

**This is a planning tool, not tax preparation software.** The goal isn't to file your taxes - it's to help you make smart directional decisions:

- Should I retire at 62 or wait until 65?
- When should I do Roth conversions?
- What withdrawal order minimizes lifetime taxes?
- How will a $50k income change affect my Medicare premiums?

**For these planning decisions, rough tax accuracy is completely sufficient.** Whether your effective tax rate is 18.3% or 18.7% doesn't change whether retiring at 62 vs 65 is the better choice.

### Subscriptions vs Control: The Real Trade-off

| Subscription Services | FB Retirement Planner |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Auto-updated tax rates (tied to ongoing payments) | You control when and how to update |
| New rates appear automatically | You decide which assumptions to use |
| Can't run "what-if" with proposed tax changes | Model future tax law scenarios easily |
| Locked into provider's assumptions | Full transparency and customization |

### When Do Tax Rates Actually Change?

Less often than you think:
- **COLA adjustments**: Annual bracket inflation adjustments (~3-5% typically)
- **Major tax law changes**: Every 5-10 years (TCJA 2017, expiring 2026)
- **Planning impact**: Usually minimal for directional decisions

### Our Commitment

- **Free updates** for major tax law changes (like TCJA expiration in 2026)
- **Easy self-service updates** for annual COLA adjustments (takes 2 minutes)
- **Documentation** on how to update assumptions from IRS publications
- **Default assumptions** clearly labeled with year and source

### The Bottom Line

**Subscription services offer automatic updates. We offer control.**

For retirement planning, having the ability to model scenarios with different tax assumptions is often more valuable than having perfectly current rates. Plus, you're not paying annually for updates you may not even need.

**Important:** FB Retirement Planner is a planning tool, not a source of tax, legal, or financial advice. Always consult qualified professionals before making major financial decisions.

## Who Is FB Retirement Planner For?

### Perfect for you if:
- You prefer **one-time purchases** over subscriptions
- You're comfortable managing your own investments
- You want **advisor-level tools** without advisor fees
- You like to **experiment with scenarios** and see the impact
- You value **privacy** and local data control

### Maybe not the best fit if:
- You prefer automatic account syncing (we use manual/CSV import)
- You want comprehensive estate planning (not our focus)
- You need hand-holding or financial advice (we're a planning tool, not an advisor)
